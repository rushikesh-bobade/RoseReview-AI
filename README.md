**RoseReview AI** is a next-generation, repository-aware code review platform that acts like a senior developer on your team. It delivers high-signal pull request reviews, identifies deployment risks, evaluates code health, and integrates directly with GitHub—all wrapped in a stunning, premium dark-mode interface.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Smart PR Analysis & GitHub Integration
- **Manual PR Tracking:** Paste any GitHub Pull Request URL into the global search bar to instantly track the repository and fetch real PR data.
- **Dynamic Context Switching:** Seamlessly switch between tracked repositories. The entire dashboard—including active PRs, analytics, and risk metrics—synchronizes instantly using a robust global state management system.
- **One-Click GitHub Commenting:** Generate comprehensive, senior-developer-styled markdown reviews directly in the dashboard, and post them directly to the GitHub PR thread with a single click.

### 2. Humanized "Senior Developer" AI Reviews
RoseReview doesn't just output generic bot feedback. It generates reviews that feel empathetic yet strict, analyzing:
- **Overall Health Score** (Security, Performance, Maintainability)
- **Blast Radius & Deployment Risk**
- **Architecture Boundaries & Dependency Coupling**
- **Specific line-level suggestions**

### 3. Premium User Experience
- **Sleek Dark Mode Aesthetics:** Designed with deep space backgrounds, glowing ambient orbs (`var(--accent-rose)`, `var(--accent-purple)`), and glassmorphism.
- **Skeleton Loading States:** When an AI analysis is running, the dashboard elegantly shifts into a pulsating skeleton loader, while the active "Analysis in progress" card remains highlighted.
- **Micro-animations & Interactive UI:** Smooth hover states, custom dropdowns, and highly responsive components built with vanilla CSS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Vanilla HTML5 / CSS3 / ES6 Modules
- Custom Design System (CSS Variables, Flexbox/Grid)
- Zero framework overhead for maximum performance

**Backend**
- Fastify (High-performance Node.js web framework)
- TypeScript
- GitHub REST API Integrations (Octokit)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm (v9+)
- A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Servers:**
   The project is structured as a monorepo. You can run the backend and frontend separately:

   *Start the Backend API:*
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:api
   ```

   *Start the Frontend Web Server:*
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:web
   ```

3. **Open the Dashboard:**
   Navigate to the local server URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser to interact with the dashboard.

### 🚀 Deploying to Vercel (Unified Deployment)

This project is pre-configured for a **full unified deployment to Vercel**. Vercel will automatically build the Vite frontend as static files, and compile the Fastify backend as a Serverless Node.js Function!

1. Import the repository into your Vercel dashboard.
2. Ensure the **Framework Preset** is set to `Vite`.
3. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` and the root `api/` directory.
4. Add your API Environment Variables in Vercel (`GROQ_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`).
5. Click **Deploy**. Vercel handles both the frontend builds and backend proxying instantly!

## 💡 How to use the AI Analysis Feature

1. Open the RoseReview Dashboard.
2. In the top navigation bar, paste a real GitHub PR URL (e.g., `owner/repo#123` or `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`).
3. Click **"Analyze PR"**.
4. Watch as the dashboard transitions into a skeleton loading state while the AI Agent simulates fetching files and evaluating code.
5. Once complete, expand the generated review card to view the senior-developer styled markdown payload.
6. Click **"Post to GitHub & Redirect"** to physically publish the comment to GitHub and open the PR!
